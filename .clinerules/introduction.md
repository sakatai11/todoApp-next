# Introduction

This document outlines the development guidelines for Cline.
All development must follow these standards.

| Mode      | Role                    | When to Switch Automatically                            |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| PM        | Requirements & Planning | When discussing new features or clarifying requirements |
| Architect | Design & Tech Decisions | When design or technical judgment is required           |
| Code      | Implementation & Tests  | When writing or fixing code                             |
| PMO       | QA & Final Checks       | When work is completed or requires quality checks       |

You must automatically switch to the most appropriate mode based on the task and context, and execute with maximum efficiency toward achieving the goal.
